      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p> 
          Hope Farm Foundation was created to support farmers with training, 
          tools, and resources to overcome these barriers, particularly for 
          youth and women who play a vital role in agriculture. We aim to empower rural communities by promoting sustainable agriculture, 
          increasing food security, and fostering innovation in farming practices.
